## 👋 Welcome to the Journey

We're a bunch of developers and designers building WallGodds—a platform where people can discover amazing wallpapers and creators can share their work. 

But here's the thing: **we're still building it.** And that's exactly why we need you.

This isn't a finished product with a small(not really!) bug list. This is an active, evolving project where your ideas actually matter. We're figuring things out as we go, making mistakes, learning, and building something we're proud of—together.

## 🎯 What We're Building

Two projects, one vision: making wallpapers accessible and beautiful.

### [WallGodds Web](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-Web) 🌐
A clean web platform for browsing and downloading wallpapers. We're working on filtering systems, user profiles, upload features, and making everything responsive.

**Current status:** Core features working, lots to improve  
**Built with:** React, Vite, Firebase  
**Open issues:** [Check them out →](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-Web/issues)

### [WallGodds App](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-App) 📱
Native Android experience built with modern Kotlin. Fast browsing, instant wallpaper setting, offline favorites—all the mobile features you'd want.

**Current status:** Early but functional  
**Built with:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase  
**Open issues:** [Check them out →](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-App/issues)

Both projects are actively developed, which means there's plenty of room for your contributions to make a real impact.

## 🚧 What We Need Help With

Real talk: we've got more ideas than hands. Here's where you can make a difference:

**Frontend Magic**
- UI/UX improvements that make sense
- Animation and micro-interactions
- Responsive design tweaks
- Performance optimizations

**Backend & Infrastructure**
- Firebase optimization
- API improvements
- Database structure refinements
- Image processing pipelines

**Features We're Planning**
- Advanced search and filtering
- User authentication flows
- Designer portfolio pages
- Rating and feedback systems
- Dark mode (everyone wants this)
- Image compression and optimization

**Design & Creative**
- Figma mockups for new features
- Brand identity elements
- Wallpaper curation
- UI component designs

Don't see your skill here? That's fine. We're open to ideas we haven't thought of yet.

## 💪 Why Join Us?

**Learn by Doing**  
Work on real features that real people will use. Not just tutorial code—actual production stuff.

**Friendly Community**  
We're on Discord every day. Questions get answered, ideas get discussed, and we actually help each other debug.

**Build Your Portfolio**  
Contribute to multiple projects. Show potential employers you can work on teams and ship features.

**No Experience Required**  
Seriously. We have `good first issue` labels for a reason. Everyone starts somewhere, and we'll help you figure it out.

**Shape the Product**  
Your suggestions can actually become features. We're not a corporate team with a locked roadmap—if it makes sense, we'll build it.

## 🌱 Perfect for Open Source Programs

We're participating in several programs that are great for newcomers:

| Program | Duration | What You Get |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** | October | T-shirts, stickers, and the joy of contributing |
| **[GSSoC '25](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/)** | 3 months | Mentorship, certificates, and real project experience |
| **[Winter of Code 4.0](https://winterofcode.tech/)** | 30 days | Structured contribution path with GDG IIIT Kalyani |
| **[JWOC Season 6](https://jwoc-2025.vercel.app/)** | 30 days | Community recognition and skill development |
| **[Apertre 2.0](https://s2apertre.resourcio.in/)** | 2 months | Portfolio building with Resourcio Community |

These programs give structure to your contributions and often provide swag, certificates, and community recognition. Win-win.

## 🤝 How to Jump In

**Step 1: Look Around**  
Browse our [Web repo](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-Web) and [App repo](https://github.com/WallGodds/WallGodds-App). Check the issues, see what people are working on, get a feel for the projects.

**Step 2: Join Discord**  
Hop into our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kTQ5KWANp8). Introduce yourself. Tell us what you're interested in working on. We'll point you in the right direction.

**Step 3: Pick Your First Issue**  
Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`. Found something? Comment on it so others know you're working on it.

**Step 4: Set Up Locally**  
Clone the repo, follow the setup instructions in the README. Having trouble? Ask in Discord—we've all been there.

**Step 5: Build and Submit**  
Make your changes, test them, push your branch, and open a PR. We'll review it together and iterate if needed.

**Step 6: Celebrate**  
Once it's merged, you're officially a contributor! Your code is now part of WallGodds. Pretty cool, right?

Each repo has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with specific guidelines. Read those first—they'll save you time.

## 🎨 For Designers

If you're more visual than verbal, we need you too.

We're working with Figma to design everything. Want to contribute designs? Check out our design files and fill out this [collaboration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDW1v7DJCkx_gGDvuMFirS6WkeRgmGGQJ9T_8UYuBHszmqFg/viewform).

Or just submit wallpapers! Check the `Wallpapers` folder in each repo for guidelines.

## 💬 Where We Hang Out

We're most active on Discord. That's where the real conversations happen—debugging sessions at 2 AM, feature debates, random memes, the works.

**Join us:**
- 💬 [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/kTQ5KWANp8) – Daily chats, help, collaboration
- 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wallgodds) – Professional updates
- 💭 [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/WallGodds/discussions) – Feature ideas and feedback
- 🐙 [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WallGodds) – Bug reports and task tracking

## 🛠️ Our Stack (For the Curious)

**Web:** React + Vite for fast development, Firebase for backend stuff  
**Mobile:** Kotlin with Jetpack Compose because we like modern Android  
**Design:** Figma for mockups and collaboration  
**Hosting:** Vercel for the web, working on Play Store[need $25 (•_•)] for the app

Nothing too fancy. We picked tools that let us move fast and stay flexible.

## ⚖️ License

Everything we build is MIT licensed. Use it, learn from it, fork it, build on it. That's the point of open source.
